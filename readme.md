TODO:
- implement wifi config
 If a wpa_supplicant.conf file is placed into the /boot/ directory, this will be moved to the /etc/wpa_supplicant/ directory the next time the system is booted, overwriting the network settings; this allows a Wifi configuration to be preloaded onto a card from a Windows or other machine that can only see the boot partition.

There are also a host of fixes for minor bugs in various parts of the system, and some general cleaning-up of themes and text.
